				Hey! This is my Github Page, and here are some of the things I've been working on lately:

						After experimenting a little with animated fractal SVGs and quickly reaching their performance limits,
						I started looking into other ways to create these animations programmatically - the end result is <a href="./gifScripter/gifScripter.html">this</a>,
						a simple javascript scripting enviroment that can create be used to create almost arbitrary gif animations.
						<br>
						This isn't really finished yet, but the core functionalities are already there - you can write or edit some code, click run, and the gif will start getting encoded.
						Things like syntax highlighting, faster encoding and some more code examples might follow a little later on.

						3D fractals with WebGL

						After seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svLzmFuSBhk">@codeparade's video</a> on raymarched fractals, I decided to try to generate a few of these myself using WebGL.
						The end result is <a href="./webglFractal3D/main.html">this</a>, a small 3d fractal renderer based on WebGL 2.
						<br>
						I've only implemented a single fractal formula so far, but I've hooked it up 7 different parameters, so there are actually a lot of different variants of the fractal available.
						I've also implemented a simple screenshotting-tool, capable of producing high-resolution images up to 6000x4000 pixels in size (at least in firefox, where I tested it).
						<br>
						Due to the limited support for WebGL2 it sadly only works in a handful of browsers, most notably firefox and chrome, so make sure you use one of these if you want to try it out.
