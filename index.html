				Hey! This is my Github Page, and here are some of the things I've been working on lately:

						A small game I've made with a few friends for a school project - the idea was basically to recreate the the classic game Snake, but in 3D and using raytracing.
						The end result looks pretty cool - we have reflections, an infitively-looping space, various interesting graphic effects, and the ability to take high-resolution screenshots.<br><br>
						Since this was for a school project, we had to use java though - so if you want to try it,
						you'll have to head over to the <a href="https://github.com/Alexandros444/Snake3001">Snake 3001 Github repository</a> and download the compiled jar file from there.<br>
						Also, if you're interested, I've uploaded a small devlog showcasing the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRCN9Fq0WQM">on youtube</a>.

						After experimenting a little with animated fractal SVGs and quickly reaching their performance limits,
						I started looking into other ways to create these animations programmatically - the end result is <a href="./gifScripter/gifScripter.html">this</a>,
						a simple javascript scripting enviroment that can create be used to create almost arbitrary gif animations.
						<br>
						This isn't really finished yet, but the core functionalities are already there - you can write or edit some code, click run, and the gif will start getting encoded.
						Things like syntax highlighting, faster encoding and some more code examples might follow a little later on.

						After seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svLzmFuSBhk">@codeparade's video</a> on raymarched fractals, I decided to try to generate a few of these myself using WebGL.
						The end result is <a href="./webglFractal3D/main.html">this</a>, a small 3d fractal renderer based on WebGL 2.
						<br>
						I've only implemented a single fractal formula so far, but I've hooked it up 7 different parameters, so there are actually a lot of different variants of the fractal available.
						I've also implemented a simple screenshotting-tool, capable of producing high-resolution images up to 6000x4000 pixels in size (at least in firefox, where I tested it).
						<br>
						Due to the limited support for WebGL2 it sadly only works in a handful of browsers, most notably firefox and chrome, so make sure you use one of these if you want to try it out.

							The first project I made on this page. It's a renderer for fractals similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot">Buddhabrot</a>,
							meaning they get generated by "tracing the path" of different points as they iterate through a formula like the one of the mandelbrot set.<br>
							Besides the actual renderer, I also implemented a simple editor for a custom tracer function  and a custom filter function;
							the tracer function is then used to trace the path of these points, while the filter function is used to filter out points above the iteration limit.
							By modifing these you can generate quite a few different fractals.
							<br><br>
							Looking back, this isn't all that great; it runs single-threaded and on the cpu only, so rendering detailed fractals with a high iteration limit can take quite a while.
							I might write a faster renderer using WebGL eventually, but since that would require Compute Shaders, it will have to wait until WebGL Compute or WebGPU are available.
